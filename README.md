Yes Bank Stock Closing Price Prediction
Overview:
This repository houses a machine learning project focused on predicting the closing prices of Yes Bank (NSE: YESBANK) stock. The goal is to develop and implement predictive models that can forecast future stock prices based on historical data, aiding in potential investment decisions and market analysis.

Project Goals:
To build robust predictive models for Yes Bank stock closing prices.

To evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms in time series forecasting.

To provide insights into factors influencing Yes Bank's stock movements.

To create a reproducible and easy-to-use framework for stock price prediction.

Features:
Data Acquisition: Scripts for fetching historical Yes Bank stock data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance, NSE website).
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, feature engineering (e.g., moving averages, technical indicators).

Model Implementation:

Time Series Models: ARIMA, SARIMA.

Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Deep Learning Models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

Model Evaluation: Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

Visualization: Plots for historical data, predictions vs. actuals, and error analysis.

Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language.
